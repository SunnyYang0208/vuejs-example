    Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.<br/><br/>
    Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.<br/><br/>
    The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.<br/><br/>
    On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.
